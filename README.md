Exclusive app :

It is an e-commerce application built using Angular language.

1) Authentication System:

A) Registration: Through it, the user can register in the application, and there are some errors that may appear to the user, such as any empty field, an error appears that the field is required, and the email is already in use, so the user must log in or use another email.

B) Log in: Through it, the user can enter the application, and in the event of errors appearing when any field is empty, this appears to the user or that the email does not exist, the user must register first. When logging in and verifying the existence of the email, the password is checked to see if it is correct or not, and if it is correct, the entry is successfully registered on the main page.

C) Log out: Through it, the user can exit the application.
D) Forgotten password: If the user forgets his password, it can be changed easily.

There is also a guard to prevent any user from entering or interacting with any pages without logging in first.

2) Products Page:
In this page, all products are displayed with some information about them, with the possibility of adding any product to the cart or wish list.

3) Categories Page:
In this page, all existing categories are displayed, with the possibility of clicking on any category to go to a page that displays the products of this category only.

4) Single Product Display Page:

In this page, only one product is displayed and all information about it with the possibility of adding it to the cart and its quantity can be changed so that the quantity of the product is one, but it is default, so the user can increase the quantity as he wants.

This product can be added to the wish list.

If the product has been added to the cart before, it will appear to the user that it has been added before, but we will increase the quantity by one and not add the product again to the cart, so a repetition will occur.

If the product is already in the wish list, this will be shown to the user that the product is already there and there is no need to add it again.

There are also some products at the end of the page that depend on the product category displayed above in order to attract the user to buy more.

The user is prevented from using the quantity button to decrease if the quantity of the product is only one because there is no quantity less than one.

5) Page 404: If the page name is entered incorrectly or the name does not exist, you will be transferred to page 404.
6) Wishlist: The products in the user's wishlist are displayed only with the ability to easily delete any product from the list or transfer all of these products to the cart to purchase them, and then the cart and total price are modified.
7) cart: Only the userâ€™s products are displayed, with the ability to easily delete any product from the cart or modify the quantity of any product, whether by increasing or decreasing it, and the price is also modified automatically.
